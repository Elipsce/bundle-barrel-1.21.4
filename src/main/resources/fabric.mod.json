	"description": "Why is there no way to automatically load bundles in vanilla? There is another mod to do this: \"Hoppers Fill Bundles,\" by Hydraheadhunter. Go check it out, you might prefer their implementation of using decorated pots! For my specific use case though, I needed multiple slots for bundles. To get a bundle barrel, craft a normal barrel with one leather in the center. Shift right click on one of the sides of the bundle barrel to change whether it empties or fills bundles (Red for positive, push out, black for negative, pull in). The top and bottom cannot be switched. For servers, the mod should function server side, but the textures and rendering might be off for clients that don't have the mod.",
